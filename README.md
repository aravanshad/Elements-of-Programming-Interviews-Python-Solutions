## Elements of Programming Interviews
### Python Solutions

In this repository, I have implemented and tested the solutions to some of the problems in [EPI book](http://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/2017/04/03/2017-04-03-python/).
I will update these files occasionally by adding solutions to more problems. 

### Install 

The solution provided here requires **Python 3.6**.
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains most of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `Solutions` folder.  

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Solutions/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook {name of notebook file}.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook {name of notebook file}.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
